### Deep Learning-Based Vegetable Image Classification System

---

## 📌 Project Overview

GreenClassify is a Deep Learning-based computer vision system designed to automatically classify vegetable images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and a pre-trained ResNet model. The system is deployed through a Flask web application, allowing users to upload vegetable images and receive instant predictions.

The primary goal of this project is to automate vegetable classification to enhance efficiency in agricultural processing facilities, supply chain quality control, and retail inventory management.

## ❗ Problem Statement

Manual vegetable classification in agricultural and retail environments is:

- Time-consuming
- Error-prone
- Labor-intensive
- Inefficient at scale

Industries handling bulk vegetable shipments face challenges such as:

1. Sorting mixed vegetables accurately.
2. Maintaining consistent quality standards.
3. Managing retail inventory efficiently.
4. Reducing waste due to misclassification or overstocking.

An automated, AI-powered system is required to:

- Classify vegetables accurately from images
- Improve operational efficiency
- Reduce human error
- Enable smart supply chain decisions
